To note that I worked in PHP 8.3

Bad practices:
	There should be more code comments - The more comments the easier it is for the reader to understand the code
	Missing Try-Catch - It helps maintain application stability and support effective debugging
	No namespace declaration - Using namespaces allows for cleaner, more maintainable, and more reliable code
	SQL querries are not prepared - This can lead to SQL injection
	DB credentials are not secured - Credentials should not be displayed like this, they should be encrypted or at least kept in a separate file with restricted permissions
	Data and return type missing - If we provide the data and return type it leaves less room for ambiguity and it can serve as an early error detection system
	DATETIME was of type string - It is better to use a dedicated library such as DateTime instead of string when using any kind of date/time data types

Changes I have made:

global
	Added namespaces
	Commented all the functions
	Added the data type for the variables (int, string, etc.)
	Added the return type declaration for all the functions
	Added Try-Catch blocks to handle errors

/class/News.php
	Made the variables private instead of protected as they are used only inside this class
	Sorted the Getters and Setters for easier readability 
/class/Comment.php
	Same as above

/utils/CommentManager.php
	Modified the listComments() function so that it can accept a newsID parameter for specific comments related to a News entity
	Made use of the exec() function from DB.php to prepare and execute the SQL queries
	Modified the date format that was provided to comply with databse DATETIME
	Delete function checks if anything was deleted or not 
/utils/NewsManager.php
	Same as above
/utils/DB.php
	Added a settings.ini file where the DB credentials are kept. 
	It is considered best practice to not keep the credentials in the same file with the log-in (in this case DB connection).
	Modified the exec() function to accept the SQL execute arguments and to check if anything was deleted by returning rowCount 
	
/index.php
	The iteration through the Comments is now more efficient as it returns only the Comments associated to the NewsID
	Added calls to all the functions from CommentManager and NewManager for easier testing.
